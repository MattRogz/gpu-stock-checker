# CC GPU Stock Checker

Python program that checks the stock/availability of GPUs at CC. (Text-Based, No GUI)

The program has 2 main ways of working.
1. Given a specific model of GPU, it will continuously check the availability of that model. This check will be performed every 20 minutes. If a GPU is found to be in stock, the program will provide you with a Windows 10 Notification.
2. Given a specific GPU model and brand(s), it will check the availabity of those GPUs and provide you with a one time update regarding the stock levels.
